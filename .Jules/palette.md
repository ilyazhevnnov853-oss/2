## 2026-01-13 - Accessibility Patterns\n**Learning:** The app relies heavily on conditional rendering for navigation. Icon-only buttons (like 'Back' and 'Home') are critical for this flow but often lack accessible labels. Standardizing `aria-label` on these buttons significantly improves screen reader navigation.\n**Action:** Always check navigation buttons in `App.tsx` and `Shared.tsx` for missing aria-labels. Ensure common components like `GlassButton` propagate accessibility props.
